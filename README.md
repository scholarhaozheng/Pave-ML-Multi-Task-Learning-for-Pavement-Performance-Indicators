Below is the English version of your README formatted in Markdown:---# Directory Structure- **txt_csv/**  - Contains data files stored in comma-separated values format.  - Files:    - `cleaned_result_array_IRI.txt`    - `cleaned_result_array_RD.txt`    - `cleaned_result_array_IRI_RDI_with_PCI.txt`- **results_images_test/**  - Stores charts generated during the training process.- **hyper_tuning/**  - Contains files generated during Kerastuner hyperparameter tuning.- `requirements_tensorflow_gpu.txt` and `requirements_tensorflow_cpu.txt`  - Provide the list of dependencies for the GPU-based and CPU-based environments, respectively.---# Data File Format## 1. cleaned_result_array_IRI.txt- Each line is in CSV format (plain text, comma-separated).- **Column 1:** Sample identifier (e.g., "100101"). Samples with contiguous years are adjacent. If there is a gap in the years for the same road section, a different sample identifier is generated.- **Columns 2 to (n-2):** Input feature data.- **Column (n-1):** The actual IRI target variable for the corresponding row.- **Column n:** The actual RD target variable for the corresponding row. If there is no corresponding RD value, the average RD is used.## 2. cleaned_result_array_RD.txt- Each line is in CSV format (plain text, comma-separated).- **Column 1:** Sample or section identifier (e.g., "100101"), similar to the IRI file.- **Columns 2 to (n-1):** Input feature data.- **Column (n):** The actual IRI target variable for the corresponding row. If there is no corresponding IRI value, the average IRI is used.- **Column (n+1):** The RD indicator value.- For generating training samples, a sliding window method is used to extract consecutive data points from the same section. The RD value from the following row is taken as the label.## 3. cleaned_result_array_IRI_RDI_with_PCI.txt- Each line is in CSV format.- **Column 1:** Sample or section identifier (e.g., "200101"). The numbering slightly differs from the previous two files to distinguish the data source.- **Columns 2 to (n_in_features + 1):** Input features, where n_in_features is the number of features excluding the identifier. This count is consistent with the previous files.- **Columns (n_in_features + 2) onwards:** Multi-task target variables, which represent multiple index values. According to the `load_data_all` function in the code, the target part consists of all columns starting from (n_in_features + 2). In this experiment, these targets correspond in sequence to IRI, RD, and PCI.---# Dependency InstallationPlease choose the appropriate dependency list based on your hardware platform:- **For a GPU-enabled environment, run:**  ```bash  pip install -r requirements_tensorflow_gpu.txt  ```- **For a CPU-only environment, run:**  ```bash  pip install -r requirements_tensorflow_cpu.txt  ```---# Usage1. **Data Preparation:**   - Place the data files in the `txt_csv` folder:     - `txt_csv/cleaned_result_array_IRI.txt`     - `txt_csv/cleaned_result_array_RD.txt`     - `txt_csv/cleaned_result_array_IRI_RDI_with_PCI.txt`2. **Running the Program:**   - Execute the main Python script to start training, tuning, and evaluation:     ```bash     python Multi-task-learning.py     ```   - The program logs output to the console during execution, generates charts saved in the `results_images_test` folder, and Kerastuner tuning files are saved in the `hyper_tuning_0405` directory.3. **Viewing the Output:**   - **Log File:** Detailed log information, including evaluation results, is stored in `txt_csv/run_output_test.txt`.   - **Chart Files:** Loss curves, hyperparameter tuning charts, scatter plots, and residual histograms are saved in the `results_images_test` folder.---
